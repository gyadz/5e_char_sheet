# 5e_char_sheet
This is a 5e D&amp;D character sheet which I work on in my free time. Not really sure what to put in a readme to be honest, this is my first actual project. I'll read some other readme files and get back to this I suppose.

The funcs file handles most of the backend stuff, feeding information from the .txt files to the rest of the program to be edited and replaced. This file will expand as more features are added to the sheet.
The main file is the vast majority of the program. It displays the UI, edits most of the data, and performs most of the calculations

Currently, I have saves, stats, and proficiencies as working pieces of this sheet. I still have a laundry list of features to add:
    Health, armor, speed, initiative, and other combat related stats
    Attacks
    Spells
    Feats
    Inventory system
